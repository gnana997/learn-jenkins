## Jenkins Jobs

# Different types of jobs that can be created in Jenkins:

# 1) Freestyle project:

- This is a central feature of Jenkins. It will build the project, combine SCM with the build system. It can also be used for things other than building applications.

# 2) Pipeline:

- This is used to create a pipeline

# 3) Multi-configuration project:

- This is great if you need a large number of Jenkins configurations if you need multiple environments like Dev/ UAT.

# 4) Folder:

- This creates containers and stores nested items. It is useful in grouping, creating a namespace, etc.

# 5) Organisation folder:

- This is used to create a multibranch project for all different subfolders that are available.

# 6) Multibranch Pipeline:

- This is used to create a pipeline for multiple branches.

## Backup & Restore Jenkins

### Backup Jenkins

- Jenkins can be backed up by copying the JENKINS_HOME directory.

  - which contains all the build configurations, build logs, and workspace files.

- It is crucial to have adequate backups of your Jenkins instance. Backups are
  used to recover from accidental configuration changes. Recovering a file that
  has been mistakenly erased or has been corrupted. Or just to recover a
  previous setup.
  There are two ways we can backup Jenkins:

  1. Using Plugins
  2. Using custom shell script

  # To backup Jenkins using plugins:

  - To backup Jenkins using a plugin, you will first need to install a backup plugin.
  - Some of the most commonly used plugins are ThinBackup, Periodic Backup,
    Google cloud Backup.
  - For backing up using any of these plugins there are a few general steps that must be followed:
    1. Creating a backup directory with read and write access
    2. Selecting files that need backup
